## UX 
### The Quiz Time
Quiz Time is a website created for those who want to test their personality according to what they do in everyday life. It is simple and seeks to understand how you spend your time on everyday activities.

### Colour Palette

## Wireframe mockups
Initially I utilised Balsamiq to produce low fidelity wireframes to organise the site structure, potential content placement locations.

## Features

### Common Features 
#### Navigation Bar

  * The navigation bar features a simple design with only a moon symbol for the Dark Theme and a sun symbol for the Light Theme. Therefore, there are two options that the user can choose between them.

#### Hero Image

  * Only the home page includes a circle that makes an apology that our lives are based on circles. The main page has two questions. The first one makes the user curious to know what he will know at the end of the quiz. The second asks if he is ready for the quizzes. Just below, there is a button to start the quiz.

#### Footer
  
  * The lower section of the common footer includes logo links to each of the social media platforms. This provides the user with a visual call to action to prompt them into visiting the social media profiles.
  * These links offer an unintrusive method of promoting the social media channels to the user, providing benefits to the organisation by the way of increased social media following.

The website has been tested by friends in different browsers ( Chorme, Firefox, Safari) and in different smarthphones, laptop and desktop. I have personally tested the site extensively with development tools to ensure that the site works responsively not only on mobile devices, but also on medium to large screens. This website is supports by resolutions Desktop(1600x992px and over), Laptop(1280x802px), Tablet(768x1024px), Mobile(320x480px).

#### Lighthouse

  * I generated a lighthouse report for the deployed site through the Google Chrome Dev Tools. I generated both a desktop and mobile report. The two reports, both for mobile and desktop, reported that the image sizes were too heavy to load. I redacted the images and turned them into Webp archive by the site [EZGIF.COM](https://ezgif.com/jpg-to-webp) and then I improved the performance score.
