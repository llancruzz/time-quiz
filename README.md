  * The lower section of the common footer includes logo links to each of the social media platforms. This provides the user with a visual call to action to prompt them into visiting the social media profiles.

## Testing

The website has been tested by friends in different browsers ( Chorme, Firefox, Safari) and in different smarthphones, laptop and desktop. I have personally tested the site extensively with development tools to ensure that the site works responsively not only on mobile devices, but also on medium to large screens. This website is supports by resolutions Desktop(1600x992px and over), Laptop(1280x802px), Tablet(768x1024px), Mobile(320x480px).

#### Lighthouse

  * I generated a lighthouse report for the deployed site through the Google Chrome Dev Tools. I generated both a desktop and mobile report. The two reports, both for mobile and desktop, reported that the image sizes were too heavy to load. I redacted the images and turned them into Webp archive by the site [EZGIF.COM](https://ezgif.com/jpg-to-webp) and then I improved the performance score.
